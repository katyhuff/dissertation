\section{Waste Package Spacing Sensitivity Validation}\label{sec:spacing}
The waste package spacing, $s$ of geologic repository concept affects the areal 
decay heat burden in the repository and has a strong effect on the thermal 
energy deposited per unit area in the medium.

\subsection{LLNL Model Results}

In the creation of the \gls{STC} database, the waste package spacing was varied 
across a number of values for each isotope, $i$, limiting 
radius $r_{calc}$, thermal diffusivity $\alpha_{th}$, and thermal conductivity $K_{th}$, considered.  By 
varying the waste package spacing of the geometric layout from $0.1-5 [m]$
this sensitivity analysis succeeds in capturing the domain of 
waste package spacings present in geologic repository concepts under 
consideration.

spacing decreases areal thermal energy deposition 
(here represented by \gls{STC}) in the near field (here $r_{calc} = 0.5m$).}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Cm242spacing_sens} shows the trend in which increased waste package spacing of a medium decreases areal thermal energy 
deposition in the near field. This indicates that waste package spacing is 
an important parameter for repository concept design.

Similarly, the location of the limiting radius has a strong effect on the 
waste package loading limit, for a fixed limiting temperature. In Figure 
\ref{fig:Cm242r_lim_sens}, the trend is demonstrated in which increased limiting 
radius decreases the thermal energy contributing to the thermal limit.

\subsection{Cyder Results}

In a similar analysis, the thermal diffusivity was compared both with the 
spacing between waste packages and the limiting radius. 

Figure \ref{fig:rs} validates the trend noted above that 
increased waste package spacing in a repository concept decreases areal thermal energy deposition 
in the near field.  Additionally, analysis with the \Cyder STC database 
demonstrates the way in which the importance of $r_{lim}$, the limiting radius, 
impacts the maximum calculated temperature at that radius.

{Cyder results agree with 
those of the LLNL model. The importance of the limiting radius decreases with 
increased $K_{th}$. The above example thermal profile results from 10kg of 
$^{242}Cm$}
