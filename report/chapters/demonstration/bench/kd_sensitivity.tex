\subsubsection{Reference Distribution Coefficient Sensitivity}

As the distribution coefficient $K_d$, and therefore the retardation 
coefficient $R_f$ increase, contaminants tend toward the solid phase. An 
increase in these coefficients, then, has the effect of limiting dissolved 
concentration.  

In the parametric sensitivity analysis discussed in Section \ref{sec:sorption}, 
the expected inverse relationship between the retardation factor and resulting 
peak annual dose was found for all elements that were not assumed to be 
effectively infinitely soluble.  In the low retardation coefficient cases, a 
regime is established in which the peak annual dose is entirely unaffected by 
changes in retardation coefficient. 

For large values of retardation coefficient, the sensitivity to small changes 
in the retardation coefficient increases dramatically. In that sensitive 
regime, the change in peak annual dose is inversely related to the retardation 
coefficient. Between these two regimes was a transition regime, in which the 
$K_d$ factor ranges from $1\times10^{-5}$ to $5\times10^{0} [-]$.

It is clear from Figures \ref{fig:KdSumFactor} and \ref{fig:KdSum} that 
for retardation coefficients greater than a threshold, the 
relationship between peak annual dose and retardation coefficient is a strong 
inverse one.
