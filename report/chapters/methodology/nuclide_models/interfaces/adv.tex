\subsubsection{Advection Dominated Mass Transfer}\label{sec:adv_mass_transfer}

The first, specified-concentration or Dirichlet type boundary conditions define 
a specified species concentration on some section of the boundary of the 
representative volume, 

    \begin{align}
      C(\vec{r},t)\Big|_{\vec{r} \in \Gamma} &= C_0(t)
      \intertext{where}
      \vec{r} &= \mbox{ position vector }\nonumber\\
      \Gamma &= \mbox{ domain boundary }.\nonumber
    \end{align}

The Dirichlet boundary condition can be provided by any mass balance model, 
based on the concentration profile calculated in the previous section,

\begin{align}
C(z,t_n)|_{z=r_j} &= \mbox{ fixed concentration in j at }r_j\mbox{ and }t_n [kg/m^3].\nonumber\\ 
                  &= \begin{cases} 
                         \frac{m_{d}(t_n)}{V_{d}(t_n)}, & \mbox{Degradation Rate}\\
                         \frac{m_{df}(t_n)}{V_{df}(t_n)}, & \mbox{Mixed Cell}\\
                         C_{out}(t_n), & \mbox{Lumped Parameter}\\
                         C(r_j,t_n), & \mbox{One Dimensional PPM}.
                      \end{cases}
\end{align}

On its inner boundary, the Lumped Parameter model uses this fixed concentration 
boundary condition directly in its solution such that, 
\begin{align}
C_{in,j}(t_n) &= C(z, t_n)|_{z=r_i}.
\end{align}

The resulting mass transfer into the external component containing the Lumped 
Parameter model is 

\begin{align}
m_{ij}(t_n) &=\int C(z,t_n)dV - \int C(z, t_{n-1})dV.
\end{align}

In the Degradation Rate and Mixed Cell models, the Dirichlet boundary condition can 
be chosen to enforce an advective flux on the inner boundary. This choice is 
appropriate when the user expects a primarily advective interface between two 
components. The advective flux across the boundary between two components $i$ 
and $j$, 

\begin{align}
J_{adv,ij}(t_n) &= \mbox{ potential advective flux from i to j at }t_n[kg/m^2/s]\nonumber\\
               &= \theta_j v C(z,t_n)|_{z=r_i}
\end{align}
relies on the fixed concentration Dirichlet boundary condition at the 
interface, provided by the internal component.

The resulting mass transfer into the Degradation Rate or Mixed Cell model
is, therefore, 
\begin{align}
m_{ij}(t_n) &= A\Delta t \theta_j v C(z,t_n)|_{z=r_i}
\intertext{where}
A &= \mbox{ surface area normal to the flow direction }[m^2]\nonumber\\
\Delta t &= \mbox{ length of the time step }[s].\nonumber
\end{align}
