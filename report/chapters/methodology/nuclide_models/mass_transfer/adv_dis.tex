\subsubsection{Explicit Coupled Advective Dispersive Mass Transfer}\label{sec:adv_dif_mass_transfer}

The third Cauchy type mixed boundary condition defines a 
solute flux along a boundary.  The fixed concentration flux Cauchy boundary 
condition can be provided at the external boundary of any mass balance model.  
For a vertically oriented system with advective velocity in the $\hat{k}$ 
direction,

    \begin{align}
      -D\frac{\partial C(z, t)}{\partial z}\Big|_{z \in \Gamma} + v_zC(z, t) &= v_zC(t) 
      \intertext{where}
      C(t) &= \mbox{ a known concentration function }[kg/m^{3}].\nonumber
    \end{align}  

In the Degradation Rate and Mixed Cell models, the Cauchy boundary condition 
can be selected to enforce coupled advective and dispersive flow,

\begin{align}
  J_{coupled} &= J_{adv} + J_{dis} \nonumber\\
  &= \theta vC(z,t_n) -\theta D\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}.
\end{align}

The resulting mass transfer into the Degradation Rate or Mixed Cell model is then, 

\begin{align}
m_{jk}(t_n) &= A\Delta t \left( \theta_k v C(z,t_n)|_{z=r_j} - \theta_k D \frac{\partial C(z,t_n)}{\partial z}|_{z=r_j} \right).
\end{align}
