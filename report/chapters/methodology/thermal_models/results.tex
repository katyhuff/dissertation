The primary outcome of this work is a mulitdimensional database of repository temperature 
change per mass of high heat contributing isotopes supporting the implementation 
of the \gls{STC} method in \Cyder. 

A validation effort concerning this tool was performed to assess the validity 
of the \gls{STC} method for the purpose of repository thermal response 
estimation.  Comparison of the results of this method with the \gls{LLNL} model 
\cite{greenberg_application_2012} gave results within the accuracy range of the 
model itself performs against the SINDA code \cite{huff_numerical_2012} and 
demonstrated the way in which inaccuracies from neglected low heat contributing 
nuclides are bounded. 

Figures \ref{fig:CmValidation} and \ref{fig:CmPercentError} show the results of 
one example validation exercise comparing the combined scaling and  
superposition calculations demonstrated in Figures \ref{fig:CmScaling} and 
\ref{fig:CmSuperposition} respectively. This particular validation example, 
containing no neglected nuclides, demonstrates an average error of 1.1\% and a 
maximum error of 4.4\%, where percent error is 
\begin{align}
\mbox{ percent error } &= 100\times\frac{\left|\Delta T_{LLNL} - \Delta T_{STC}\right|}{ \Delta T_{LLNL}}.
\end{align}

% Unit Test Results
In addition to this validation effort, continual verification of code behavior 
is enabled by a suite of unit tests packaged with the tool. These tests are 
provided along with the source code so that they may be performed to evaluate 
the implementated behavior of units of functionality within the interpolation 
and specific temperature change algorithms even as the code is improved in the 
future.
