	abstract = {Thermal diffusivity measurements of seven igneous rocks were made to temperatures of {400°C} and pressures of 200 {MPa.} The measuring method was based on the concept of cylindrical symmetry and periodic heat pulses. The seven rocks measured were Westerly (Rhode Island) granite, Climax Stock (Nevada) quartz monzonite, Pomona (Washington) basalt, Atikokan (Ontario, Canada) granite, Creighton (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, East Bull Lake (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, and Stripa (Sweden) granite. The diffusivity of all the rocks showed a positive linear dependence on inverse temperature and, excluding the East Bull Lake gabbro, showed a linear dependence on quartz content. (Quartz content varied from 0 to 31\% by volume.) Diffusivity in all cases rose or remained steady with increasing confining pressure. The pressure effect was strongest at lowest pressures and vanished by levels between 10 and 100 {MPa}, depending on rock type. The pressure effect (measured as a percentage change in diffusivity) is stronger in the four rocks of granitic composition than in the three of basaltic composition. Our results agree well with existing thermal diffusivity measurements at atmospheric pressure.},

	abstract = {The environmental impact of different fuel cycles based on Pressurized Water Reactor ({PWR)} and Fast Reactors ({FR)} has been assessed and compared. The study has been carried out by coupling two models: a waste conditioning model that determines the composition of the vitrified High Level Waste ({HLW)} and a radionuclide transport model that takes into account the release of radionuclide through the Engineered Barrier Systems ({EBS)} after failure of the canisters of a water-saturated repository. It follows from the study that the environmental impact per electricity generated of a {PWRMOX} system is substantially higher than the ones observed for {PWR-UO\{sub} 2\} and {FRs.} These differences are to be related to the waste conditioning constraints that determine the dilution of waste radionuclides within the borosilicate glass. A removal of the high heat emitting radionuclides such as Cm-244 is to that regard advisable. Numerical results show that the {PWR} cases studied here are more sensitive than {FR} systems to geologic repository characteristics such as the Canister Failure Time ({CFT).} For short {CFT}, this relatively high sensitivity is mainly due to Am-241.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In this paper, it is shown that a previously reported non-linear, one-dimensional, theoretical approximation simplifies -- from a computational point of view -- the calculation of the time-decay temperature field in nuclear waste repositories ({NWR).} This conclusion has been reached after solving, by using the control volume numerical method, the full three dimensional, transient, non-linear heat diffusion equation. The transient thermal field in a rock salt repository, is analytically solved and numerically predicted, along 100 years, after the disposal of a high-level waste ({HLW).} The nuclear waste, with a half-life of 32.9 years, releases an exponentially time dependent heat flux with 12 W m-2 as the initial thermal load. Two cases are studied, in the first one it is assumed that the conductivity (k) and the volumetric heat capacity [rho]cp of the host rock (diffusion domain) remain constant (linear case), whereas in the second one, a more realistic situation is analysed. In this last case, the conductivity of the rock salt varies as a function of the temperature field and the product [rho]×cp remains constant (non-linear case). In order to observe the effect of the salt conductivity (constant or variable) on the repository temperature distribution, a comparison of both cases is performed. It is concluded, that the theoretical model, which provides an analytical solution of the thermal fields may be a powerful low cost method for design purposes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Thermal and physical properties were measured on 206 Jurassic granite samples obtained from three boreholes in the central part of Korea. Thermal conductivity (λ), thermal diffusivity (α), and specific heat (Cp) were measured in a laboratory; the average values are λ=2.813 {W/mK} (1.962- 3.867 {W/mK)}, α=1.296 mm2/sec (0.93-1.787 mm2/sec), Cp=0.816 {J/gK} (0.750-0.877 {J/gK)}, respectively. In addition, porosity (φ), and dry and saturated density(ρ) were measured; the average values are φ =0.01 (0.002-0.041), ρ (dry)=2.662 g/cm3 (2.540-2.760 g/cm3), and ρ (saturated)=2.67 g/cm3 (2.547-2.771 g/cm3), respectively.  Experimental data show that thermal conductivity increases with increasing thermal diffusivity and decreases with increasing porosity.  However, thermal conductivity does not show good correlation with density. Thermal diffusivities of 10 granite samples were measured with increasing temperature from 25° C to 200° C.  In this study, we found that thermal diffusivity at 200° C is about 30\% lower than thermal diffusivity at 25° C. Using mixing law models, thermal conductivity of a rock sample can be estimated from its mineral contents.  The estimated average thermal conductivity values using a geometric and a square-root mean models are 3.685 {W/mK} and 4.030 {W/mK} with average relative errors of 22.7\% and 33.9\%, respectively.  Granite samples mainly consist of quartz ({\textasciitilde}38 Vol\%, 7.69 {W/mK)} and albite ({\textasciitilde}30 Vol\%, 2.14 {W/mK).}  Two main mineral compositions (quartz and albite) strongly influence thermal conductivity of granite.  A  linear equation including two main components was derived from multiple linear regression (λ=-{0.014·VQuartz-} {0.047·VAlbite+5.0}, where V is Vol\%). Specific gravities were measured on 10 granite samples in the laboratory.  The measured specific gravity ranges from 2.603 to 2.669. The specific gravity depends on chemical compositions of granite. Therefore, specific gravity can be estimated by the felsic-mafic index (F) that is calculated from chemical contents.  The estimated specific gravity ranges from 2.643 to 2.658. The average relative error between measured and estimated specific gravities  is 0.677\%.},

Until recently, repository metrics in such codes were based on mass and were independent of the isotopic composition of the waste. A methodology has been developed for determining peak repository loading for an arbitrary set of isotopics based on the heat load restrictions and current geometry specifications for the Yucca Mountain repository. This model was implemented in the {VISION} fuel cycle scenario analysis code and is used here to study the effects of separation efficiencies on repository loading for various {AFCI} fuel cycle scenarios. Improved separations efficiencies are shown to have continuing technical benefit in fuel cycles that recycle Am and Cm, but a substantial benefit can be achieved with modest separation efficiencies.

This approach was selected in favor of the finite element solution typically used to 
analyze the temperature response because it allowed rapid comparison of a large

Based on the detailed computational Clay Generic Disposal Sys- tem Model ({GDSM)} developed by the Used Fuel Disposition ({UFD)} campaign [1], these results provide an overview of the relative importance of processes that affect the repository per- formance of a generic clay disposal concept model. Further analysis supports a basis for development of rapid abstracted models in the context of system level fuel cycle simulation. Processes and parameters found to influence repository perfor- mance include the rate of waste form degradation, timing of waste package failure, and various coupled geochemical and hydrologic characteristics of the natural system including dif- fusion, solubility, and advection.},

	abstract = {Fuel cycle scenario analysis codes are valuable tools for investigating the effects of various decisions on the performance of the nuclear fuel cycle as a whole. Until recently, repository metrics in such codes were based on mass and were independent of the isotopic composition of the waste. A methodology has been developed for determining peak repository loading for an arbitrary set of isotopics based on the heat load restrictions and current geometry specifications for the Yucca Mountain repository. This model was implemented in the {VISION} fuel cycle scenario analysis code and is used here to study the effects of separation efficiencies on repository loading for various {AFCI} fuel cycle scenarios. Improved separations efficiencies are shown to have continuing technical benefit in fuel cycles that recycle Am and Cm, but a substantial benefit can be achieved with modest separation efficiencies.},
