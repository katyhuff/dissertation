By this time 5500 thm of vitrified high level waste will have accumulated. Both types of waste will be finally disposed of in one underground repository. Potential host rocks are rock salt, granite and mudrock. Up to now several performance assessment studies have been carried out in order to identify the main parameters governing the long-term safety of such repositories. The disposal concepts investigated differ widely in the water content of the rock formations, the engineered barrier systems and the sorption capacities of the various materials.

Until recently, repository metrics in such codes were based on mass and were independent of the isotopic composition of the waste. A methodology has been developed for determining peak repository loading for an arbitrary set of isotopics based on the heat load restrictions and current geometry specifications for the Yucca Mountain repository. This model was implemented in the {VISION} fuel cycle scenario analysis code and is used here to study the effects of separation efficiencies on repository loading for various {AFCI} fuel cycle scenarios. Improved separations efficiencies are shown to have continuing technical benefit in fuel cycles that recycle Am and Cm, but a substantial benefit can be achieved with modest separation efficiencies.

The seven rocks measured were Westerly (Rhode Island) granite, Climax Stock (Nevada) quartz monzonite, Pomona (Washington) basalt, Atikokan (Ontario, Canada) granite, Creighton (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, East Bull Lake (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, and Stripa (Sweden) granite. The diffusivity of all the rocks showed a positive linear dependence on inverse temperature and, excluding the East Bull Lake gabbro, showed a linear dependence on quartz content. (Quartz content varied from 0 to 31\% by volume.) Diffusivity in all cases rose or remained steady with increasing confining pressure. The pressure effect was strongest at lowest pressures and vanished by levels between 10 and 100 {MPa}, depending on rock type. The pressure effect (measured as a percentage change in diffusivity) is stronger in the four rocks of granitic composition than in the three of basaltic composition. Our results agree well with existing thermal diffusivity measurements at atmospheric pressure.},

series of point sources, and a series of parallel infinite line sources were combined with 
a quasi-steady-state multi-layered cylindrical solution to simulate the temperature 
response of a deep geologic radioactive waste repository with multi-layered natural and 
engineered barriers.  
This evaluation was performed to provide information to scientists and decision makers 
to compare candidate geologic media for a repository (crystalline rock [granite], clay, 
salt, and deep borehole), and to provide input for the future evaluation of the trade-off 
between pre-emplacement surface storage time, waste package size, and repository 
footprint.
This approach was selected in favor of the finite element solution typically used to 
analyze the temperature response because it allowed rapid comparison of a large 
number of alternative disposal options and design configurations.  More than 100
combinations of waste form, geologic environment, repository design configuration, and 
surface storage times were analyzed and compared.},
